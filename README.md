Great Pyr Blog Site - Software Development 2 (C#/.NET) Project

This project is about a blog website that I created to help dog owners and Great Pyranees breed owners in particular learn more about their animals and how to better take care of them. 
Thre are two main sections to this blog website. First section is "Admin-Login" section. This section allows user to log in to the website, enter username and password and then be redirected 
to "Admin-Panel" section. In "Admin-Panel" section user then appends newly created homepage (that is placed in either "Dog Food", "Dog Health" or "Grooming" folder) to SQLExpress "gp" database.
Once newly created webpage is appended to the database, counter on the right changes indicating total number of articles under that particular section. Second section of this blog website
is the actual interface where visitors can access and read blog articles organized in three four different sections "Home", "Dog Food", "Dog Health" and "Grooming". "Home" section lists all
of the published blog articles while each of the other sections only lists articles related to that particular section. 

This project was designed and made to be accessed in Microsoft Visual Studio.

This project is built to meet the following requirements of Software Development 2 (C#/.NET) Louisville January 2022 session.

Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application (data on blog articles is stored and retrieved via SqlExpress database)
Create an additional class which inherits one or more properties from its parent. (used throughout my project)
Visualize data in a graph, chart, or other visual representation of data (data on blog articles is retrieved from SQL database and displayed on the website in an organized fashion)
Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program (used throughout my project)
Calculate and display data based on an external factor (ex. get the current date, and display how many days remaining until some event) (Each blog article displays the exact data/time of its 
submission.)
